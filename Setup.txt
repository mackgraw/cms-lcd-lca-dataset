# CMS LCD/LCA Dataset (Daily Sharded Workflow)

This project pulls Medicare **Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs)** and **Local Coverage Articles (LCAs)** from the CMS **Coverage API**, shards the workload, merges outputs, normalizes codes, computes day-over-day changes, and publishes assets to a daily Release.

## Quick start (local)

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
